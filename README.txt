Flask-App and VK-Bot to automate work with students' and teachers' schedule in Tyumen College of Transport Technologies and Services

Before start:
1. Add script file named 'ensure_admin.sql' in database_scripts catalogue.
For example: INSERT OR REPLACE INTO "main"."users" ("id", "login", "password", "role") VALUES ('1', 'admin', 'password', 'administrator');
Where password is hash generated by werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash method.
2. Create vk_config.py file with configuration of your VK Callback API server inside it.
3. Import sqlite3 module and create_db function from main module and call it. This will create a database for your app.
4. Create text file 'app_secret_key.txt' with secure secret key in it.
5. Do not forget to create schedule directories: static/schedule/groups/lists/, static/schedule/groups/schedules/, static/schedule/teachers/lists/ and static/schedule/teachers/schedules/
